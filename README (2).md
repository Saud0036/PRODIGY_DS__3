# Prodigy_Task3

In this task, I worked on Decision Tree Classifier – Bank Marketing Prediction Project
Built a Decision Tree classification model to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service using the Bank Marketing dataset (UCI ML Repository).
 The project involved data preprocessing, encoding categorical variables, train-test splitting, model building, and performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
 This project helped me understand how demographic and behavioral data can be used to make data-driven business decisions.
